# 3D Rasterizer
**A fully functional 3D rasterizer that can display .xyz files, incorporating:
* matrix transformation
* backface elimination
* painter's algorithm
* view frustum clipping
* dynamic vector-based lighting 
Based on the 2D rendering library FPToolkit. There's an additional tool that allows a user to generate a custom solid of revolution .xyz file.
